Added new line
This line is change so that I could make a new commit in this file at local repo and then pushed this changed file with new branch named b2, over remote repo.
So, now there will be a pull request for b1 and b1 will also have to fetch and merge this change in its branch. And finally it will be merged in master and pull will be closed.
