Added new line
This line is change so that I could make a new commit in this file at local repo and then pushed this changed file within branch named b1 of other user, over remote repo.
So, now there will be a pull request for b1 (of other user) and other user will also have to fetch and merge this change in his local b1 branch. And finally it will be merged in master and pull will
be losed.
