this act as a file of another user for his new branch named b1. This b1 has pulled the files of master and then merged those files in it along with this file.
Now main repo has another branch b1 which has overridden main files, so local user means I will fetch origin again and then will checkout this b1 branch at my local 
repo and after this I have now a synced version / updated version of remote repo ( main/master and b1 ) at my local repo.
